# sql-challenge


This is the Challenge revolving around the basics of SQL and especially QUICKDBD, PGADMIN and POSTGRE. This is relatively straightforward as it focuses on using a scheme to create the appropriate tables within PGADMIN and then creating another sql file that contains all of the relevant scripts to answer each of the questions for the data analysis componene. 

This diagram was first created using Quick Data Based Diagrams. Primary keys, foreign keys and the formats of the data within each columns are set out through her. All of the relationships between the listed tables are also visualised here.

Then through VSC, a schema was created for each of the tables, ensuring that if each of the tables had already exist, it would be deleted before creating another one with the appropriate formatting. Primary keys are also created where appropriate and columns are altered at the end of the schema to ensure that the number of columns for each table is correct.

Once the tables are created and the data is imported from their respective files, another query was contructed to answer each of the questions.
